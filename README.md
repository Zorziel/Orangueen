# Orangueen 
This repository contains Orangueen themes for various apps and sites.  

Orangueen originally started as an attempt to theme my various apps like my [Dark Gold theme](https://github.com/Zorziel/Dark-Gold), but then grew into something much more.  Orangueen is meant for dark themes, with orange being the important header, title and code bits; blue for non-critical headers and quotes, and green for various formatting; which all results in a nice, dark theme with pops of color throughout.  

The Name `Orangueen` is just a contraction of **Orang**~~e~~ + ~~Bl~~**ue** + ~~Gre~~**en** (or **Orang**~~e~~ + ~~Bl~~**u**~~e~~ + ~~Gr~~**een** )

For exmaples, please see the [screenshots](https://github.com/Zorziel/Orangueen#screenshots) section below or check out [zorz.org's privacy policy page](https://zorz.org/about.html).
